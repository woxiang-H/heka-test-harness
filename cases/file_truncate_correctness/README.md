# File Truncate Correctness Test

This test verifies that the read position of a file is reset in the event of
truncation. Failing to do so typically results loss of any new data written to the file.

## Design

1. Each subject is configured to tail a test log file and send it to a downstream service.
2. The subject is started.
3. The test log file is truncated.
4. A unique new line is added to the test log file.
5. Assert that the downstream service received the unique new line.

## Results

|     Subject | Result  |
|------------:|:-------:|
|    Filebeat |    ✅    |
|   FluentBit |    ✅    |
|     FluentD |    ✅    |
|    Logstash |    ✅    |
|   Splunk HF |    ✅    |
|   Splunk UF |    ✅    |
|  **Vector** |    ✅    |

## Try it

You can run this test via:

```
test -t file_truncate_correctness
```
